  "aboutWelcome": "Thank you for your interest in ICF Warsaw.  Unfortunately, many people have experienced church as unimportant, uncomfortable, or insignificant.  From our own experience, we know that this need not be true.  That's why we celebrate God with fun fellowship, contemporary worship, and inspiring, applicable messages that will literally change your life! \n We use English here because of the thousands of people living in Warsaw from all over the world who have not learned Polish yet, but still desire to be an integral part of a church family.  The ICF family consists of people from dozens of countries and every walk of life, creating a beautiful mosaic of community.  Come join a church where people are there for each other, are growing in their love for God and others, and are boldly venturing into the abundant life God wants all His children to find."
